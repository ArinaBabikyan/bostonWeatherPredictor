# Boston Weather Predictor

A GRU-based multivariate time-series weather forecasting model integrated into a Django web application for real-time weather prediction and visualization of the East Coast.

## Features

- **GRU-based forecasting model**  
  Built with PyTorch using hourly meteorological data to predict weather patterns with high accuracy. The model outperforms persistence baselines with an MSE of 8.999 compared to 10.249.

- **Real-time prediction**  
  The model is integrated into a Django-based web app that runs locally and provides weather predictions based on user-input longitude and latitude.

- **Interactive visualization**  
  Users can view detailed forecasts and weather trends dynamically within the application interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Django  
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/boston-weather-predictor.git
   cd boston-weather-predictor
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run migrations and start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
### Usage

Enter the longitude and latitude of the desired East Coast location.

The app will display real-time weather forecasts generated by the GRU model.
